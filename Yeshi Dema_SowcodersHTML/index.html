    <!--About reading -->
    <h2>What is Reading?</h2>
    <p class="a">Reading is defined as a cognitive process
       that involves decoding symbols to arrive at
       meaning (Sandhu,2020). Reading is an active process
       of forming meanings. Reading helps the reader to
       direct information towards one's goal. Though the
       reasons for reading may vary but the main purpose of
       reading is to understand the text and explore beyond
       one's knowledge.</p>
       <h2>Benifits of Reading</h2>
       <p class="a">When was the last time you read a book or
         any magazine artcle? If you hardly remember reading
         a book, make reading your daily habit because reading
         has a signinficant number of benifits. So, what are
         you waiting for?! Here are some benifits of reading
         to get you start reading.</p>
         <ol>
           <li>Mental Stimulation</li>
           Studies on reading have shown staying mentally
           stimulated can slow the possibilty of having
           Alzhemer's and dementia. It is due to the fact that
           when the brain is kept active and engaged, it is
           prevented from losing power. <br><br>

           height:20%;"> </center> <br>
           The brain just like any other muscles in our body,
           requires exercise to keep it strong and healthy.
           The games such as playing chess have also been found
           to contribute to cognitive stimulation.
           <br><br>
           <li>Stress Reduction</li>
           The stress we have at our work, in our personal
           issues or any other issues faced in our daily lives,
           it all just slips away when you are submerged in a
           great story. A book that is well written can take you
           to the other realms.<br><br>
           <center>
           <img src="img4.webp" alt="stress"> </center> <br>

           <li>Knowledge</li>
           When you read, it fills up your head with new bits of
           information and you never know when it might come in
           handy. If you are filled with every knowledge from a
           book, then you are better equipped to tackle any
           challenge in your daily life. Even if you lose every-
           thing else, your job, your health, even your money, but
           remeber knowledge can never be taken from you.
           <br><br>

           <img src="img5.webp" alt="knowledge"> </center> <br>
           <li>Vocabulary Expansion</li>
           If you are articulate and well-spoken then it is of
           great help in any profession and you can also speak to
           your higher-ups with confidence. In one way or either,
           reading helps to build your self-esteem. Reading book is
           also vital for learning new languages. The more you read,
           the more words you gain exposure to and thus making
           their way into your everyday vocabulary.

           height:20%;"> </center> <br>
           <li>Memory Improvement</li>
           When you read a book, you have to remember history,
           backgrounds, characters and all those sub-plots. Every new
           memory you create forges new brain pathways and strengthens
           existing ones.
           <br><br>
           <li>Thinking Skills</li>
           The ability to analyze details also comes in handy when it
           comes to critiquing the plot like  determining whether it
           was a well-written piece, if the characters were properly
           developed and all. You will be able to discuss the book
           with others and you'll be able to state your opinions
           clearly.
           <br><br>
           <li>Improved Focus and Concentration</li>
            Attention of the people is drawn to different directions
            such as people checking their emails, chatting with one
            another, working on task, monitoring their smartphones and
            interacting with their workers. Such kind of activities
            leads their stress level to rise. So, when you read a book,
            your attention is drawn to a story and you just forget about
            the rest of the world. You can try from where you are right
            now. Go grab a book or you can get it from online and try
            reading for 15-20 minutes. You'll be surprised at how much
            you are focused once you start doing your work.

            <li>Better Writing Skills</li>
            The writers usually enhance their skills on writing by
            reading the works of others. The act of reading can help
            you to incorporate new writing styles into your work and
            give fresh perspectives that can be used in your writing.
            Read actively in order to discover creative writing
            strategies, word choices and syntax control to incorporate
            into your writing skills.

            <li>Tranquility</li>
            The subject that you read about can bring about immmense
            inner peace and tranquility. For example, reading a
            spiritual text can lower blood pressure and can bring
            sense of calm. Reading self-help books help people
            suffering from certain mood disorders, mental illnesses
            and keeps them motivated.

            <li>Free Entertainment</li>
            Many of us want to buy books since we can use it for
            our future references and it is also good for our eyes to
            read from the pages besides reading from the screen. We can
            visit our local libraries and get some drive in it for
            free. If you happen to live in an area where you don't have
            an access to the libraries, most libraries have thier books
            available in PDF or in ePub format so that you can read them
            on your e-reader, iPad or on your computer screen. Actually
            it is not recommended to read from the screens due to the
            production of short-wavelength blue light causing harm
            to our eyes. But modern problems do have modern solutions.
            To prvent our eyes from the harmfuls light, we can use some
            applications such as ReadEra, also the mobile these days
            have eye comfort sheild and all, in which these functions
            take control over the harmful light.
