    <h1 class="one"> Mission</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="a"> The mission of Read for Bhutan is "To
      maintain and improve the quality of life for all
      citizens of our community by providing resources and
      even some programmes that enhance and contribute
      to individual's knowledge, enlightenment and
      enjoyment." We are committed to foster a love of
      reading, improve literacy skills and support the
      emotional well-being in our communities. We believe in
      the power of educational systematic racism, poverty
      and social inequality. To support every individual
      of our nation in developing lifelong literacy skills,
      Read for Bhutan is committed in making books a part of
      every individual's life.
      <br>
      To accomplish our mission, we have books to download
      given in the product link. You can download it from
      there :).

      <h1 class="one"> About me</h1>
      <br>
      <p class="a"> I am Yeshi Dema. We all might be knowing
        how important is reading to us. Our government is
        working so hard in enhancing the citizens of Bhutan
        starting from the young children to indulge in reading.
        Every schools are having reading hours apart from their
        subject matters. Even the Bhutan Broadcasting Services
        have made programmes on reading whereby adults and
        students used to narrate or either review on what they
        have read. So, I as a Bhutanese citizen would like
        to contribute to the community in one way or other
        by offering some free book downloads on our website.
        If you all have any book donations to be made, do email
        me or leave a comment down below.
        Every week, the downloads will be updated. So stay tuned
        and Happy Reading!!!
